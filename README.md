# Data Analysis of Space Missions (1957–Present)

## Overview
This project presents an in-depth **data analysis of global space missions** conducted since 1957.  
Using the dataset **`Space_Corrected.csv`**, it explores launch frequencies, mission outcomes, rocket performance, and cost distributions to reveal key insights into the evolution of the space industry.

The analysis focuses on identifying the most active companies, mission success trends, expenditure comparisons, and global participation in space exploration.

##  Analysis Performed
1. **Number of Launches by Each Company**  
   → Identified top organizations with the highest number of missions.  
2. **Rocket Status Distribution**  
   → Compared the proportion of active vs. retired rockets.  
3. **Mission Status Overview**  
   → Analyzed the success and failure rates of missions.  
4. **Rocket Cost Distribution (by Rocket Status)**  
   → Compared cost differences between active and inactive rockets.  
5. **Rocket Cost Distribution (by Mission Status)**  
   → Evaluated how mission outcome correlates with cost.  
6. **Total Expenditure by Each Company**  
   → Calculated total money spent per organization.  
7. **Mission Count by Year**  
   → Visualized the trend of launches over time.  
8. **Countries and Mission Status**  
   → Examined how mission results vary across countries.  
9. **Sunburst Chart Analysis**  
   → Hierarchical visualization (Company → Country → Mission Status).  
10. **World Map Visualization**  
    → Mapped mission outcomes geographically.
